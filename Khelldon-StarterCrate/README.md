**Description:**
# Starter Crate
This modlet gives the player a crate of random *likely* low tier gear to start the game with.

Details:
- Loot is mostly random but generally of the following types:
  hat
  melee weapon
  tools
  pieces of armor
  items of medicine
  canned food

STATUS: Seeing if can borrow XML from https://github.com/wolfbain5/7dtd-a19, via forum question

a20 change: made loot more random, and chance of less items. Feels nice and "may be great, may not be" chances.
Removed mining helmet as this is pretty OP day 1. Small chance of a beaker or other decent items.
