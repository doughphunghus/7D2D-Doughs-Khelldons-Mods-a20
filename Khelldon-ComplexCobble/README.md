# Complex Cobble!
This modlet changes the recipes for cobblestone to make it more difficult to craft.

Details:
- Both stone types require a new item "mortar" to craft and repair the blocks.
- Mortar is user craftable and can be made without a workbench, workstation, etc.

a20 changes: 
- Mortar now requires cement and lime (new item). Before is was just cobblestones. Done on purpose (up difficulty a tad) because block upgrade patch has changed.
